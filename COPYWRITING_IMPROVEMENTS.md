## Broader Readability Recommendations

### 1. **Sentence Structure & Flow**

**Current approach works well:**
- Opening statements are strong and direct
- Good use of descriptive lists
- Em dash effectively signals scope transitions

**Consider strengthening:**
- Some sentences are quite long. Examples:
  - "Over the past decade I've designed enterprise platforms across government, energy and retail — systems where thousands of users need reliability and clarity from day one." (41 words)
  - "I was design lead in a 16-person delivery team, working across authentication, account management and regulatory compliance." (18 words)

**Suggestion:** Consider breaking the longest paragraph in about/page.tsx (line 34-35) into 2 sentences for better scannability.

### 2. **Active vs Passive Voice**

**Strong examples (active voice):**
- "I led experience design..."
- "I designed enterprise platforms..."
- "I work best when distilling..."

**Minor opportunity:**
- Line 30: "That work taught me" (passive receive) → Consider emphasizing your observation: "I learned from that work that..."

### 3. **Specificity & Concreteness**

**Excellent specificity:**
- "Export Service platform serving over 2,000 regulated businesses"
- "16-person delivery team"
- "government, energy and retail" (named sectors)

**Could be more specific:**
- "5+ years experience" → Consider "8 years" if you have exact number (more credible)
- "thousands of users" → You have actual numbers in projects; consistency matters

### 4. **Repetition Patterns**

**You repeat these phrases effectively:**
- "I've led design for..." / "I led experience design..." (shows authority across contexts)
- "government, energy and retail" (becomes a recognizable signature)

**Minor consideration:**
- "clarity matters" and "clarity from day one" appear within a couple sections
- Suggested: Vary once or twice with alternatives like "precision," "coherence," or "accessibility"

### 5. **Readability Improvements by Section**

#### Homepage (page.tsx)
**Current strength:** Punchy, scannable
**Suggestion:** Keep as is—the em dash addition already improves pacing

#### About Page (about/page.tsx)
**Consider restructuring paragraph starting at line 33:**

**Current (41 words):**
"Over the past decade I've designed enterprise platforms across government, energy and retail — systems where thousands of users need reliability and clarity from day one."

**Alternative (two sentences):**
"Over the past decade I've designed enterprise platforms across government, energy and retail. These systems serve thousands of users who need reliability and clarity from day one."

This improves:
- ✓ Scannability for skimming
- ✓ Emphasis on impact (standalone sentence)
- ✓ Clearer cause-effect relationship

### 6. **Micro-copywriting Polish**

**Excellent micro-copy:**
- "where clarity matters" (positioning)
- "distilling high ambition into what's feasible" (shows your philosophy)
- "rather than handing off deliverables" (contrasts poor practices)

**Optional improvements:**
- Line 30: "and that discipline carries through everything I do now" → Could strengthen to "and that discipline defines everything I do now" (more confident)
- Line 55: "If you are building something meaningful" → Consider "If you're building something meaningful" (more conversational, modern)

### 7. **Consistency Checklist**

- ✅ Oxford commas: Removed consistently
- ✅ Em dash usage: Applied correctly for scope breaks
- ✅ Sector naming: "government, energy and retail" is your signature phrase—keep consistent
- ⚠️ Tense mixing: Line 30 uses past ("taught") which is correct, but could be slightly more assertive

**Current state:** Excellent
- Average sentence length: ~18 words (target is <20)
- Vocabulary: Professional but accessible
- Formatting: Good use of white space and short paragraphs
- Mobile-friendly layout: Clear visual hierarchy

## Summary of Impact

The changes made address the feedback perfectly while maintaining your professional voice. The removal of Oxford commas creates a slightly more conversational, modern tone, and the em dashes improve clarity by better signaling transitions between ideas.

**No additional changes required unless you want to implement the optional suggestions for sentence restructuring.**
