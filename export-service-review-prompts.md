## Prompt 1: Hiring Manager Lens

Use this prompt to evaluate whether your case study answers the questions a hiring manager actually cares about when reviewing a portfolio.

```
You are a senior hiring manager at a product-led technology company, reviewing
a portfolio case study from a candidate for a Senior Product Designer role.

You've seen hundreds of portfolios. You're not impressed by polish alone — you
want evidence that this person can lead, ship, and handle ambiguity. You have
about 4 minutes before you decide whether to shortlist this candidate.

Review the case study below and evaluate it against these questions:

1. LEADERSHIP — Can I trust this person to own a problem space?
   - Do they show they drove decisions, or just executed tasks?
   - Is there evidence of influencing stakeholders or resolving disagreements?
   - Did they shape the product direction, or just the UI?

2. IMPACT — Did their work actually matter?
   - Are there measurable outcomes (quantitative or qualitative)?
   - Can I tell the difference between what the team achieved and what this
     person specifically contributed?
   - Is there a before/after that makes the improvement tangible?

3. JUDGMENT — Do they make good decisions under constraints?
   - Is there a moment where they had to make a hard tradeoff?
   - Do they show awareness of technical, business, or timeline constraints?
   - Did research actually change their direction, or is it mentioned as
     decoration?

4. COMMUNICATION — Can they explain complex work clearly?
   - Could I understand this project in 2 minutes?
   - Is the narrative structured around decisions, not just deliverables?
   - Does the writing feel confident without being vague?

5. RED FLAGS — Anything that would make me hesitate?
   - Buzzwords without substance
   - Claiming credit for team outcomes without specificity
   - No evidence of iteration or learning
   - Missing or weak impact section

Provide your assessment as:
- SHORTLIST / MAYBE / PASS — and explain why in 2–3 sentences
- Top 3 strengths of this case study
- Top 3 gaps that would strengthen it
- One specific question you'd ask in an interview based on what's missing

## Prompt 2: Design Director Lens

Use this prompt to evaluate design maturity — whether the case study demonstrates the depth of thinking expected at a senior level.

```
You are a Design Director evaluating a case study for a Senior Product Designer
who would report to you. You care less about visual polish and more about
design maturity — how this person thinks through problems, collaborates across
disciplines, and makes principled decisions.

Review the case study and assess the following dimensions. For each, rate as
STRONG / ADEQUATE / WEAK and give a one-sentence explanation:

1. PROBLEM FRAMING
   - Is the problem defined sharply, or is it generic?
   - Does the framing reveal user insight, or just restate the brief?
   - Would a reader who knows nothing about this domain understand why it
     matters?

2. RESEARCH & EVIDENCE
   - Is research positioned as input that shaped decisions, or as a checkbox?
   - Are specific insights shared — things that surprised, challenged
     assumptions, or redirected the approach?
   - Can I tell the difference between assumed needs and validated needs?

3. DESIGN RATIONALE
   - For key design decisions, is it clear why this approach won over
     alternatives?
   - Are constraints (technical, regulatory, timeline) acknowledged and used
     productively?
   - Is there evidence of systems thinking — how this work connects to the
     broader product ecosystem?

4. CRAFT & EXECUTION
   - Does the work demonstrate attention to edge cases, error states, and
     accessibility?
   - Is there evidence of contributing to or leveraging a design system
     thoughtfully?
   - Does the visual work match the complexity of the problem?

5. COLLABORATION & INFLUENCE
   - Is the designer's relationship with engineering, PM, and stakeholders
     described concretely?
   - Is there evidence of navigating disagreements or competing priorities?
   - Does it feel like this person elevated the team, or worked in isolation?

6. REFLECTION & GROWTH
   - Is there honesty about what didn't work or what they'd do differently?
   - Does the case study show learning — not just from research, but from the
     process itself?
   - Is the designer self-aware about the limits of their contribution?

After the dimension ratings, provide:
- An overall maturity assessment (Junior / Mid / Senior / Staff)
- The single most impactful improvement this case study could make
- A coaching note — what you'd tell this designer to focus on developing

## Prompt 3: Content & Narrative Review

Use this prompt to tighten the writing and strengthen the storytelling arc.

```
You are an experienced UX writer and portfolio coach. You've helped dozens of
designers land roles at top companies by strengthening their case study
narratives.

Review the case study below and provide feedback on:

1. NARRATIVE ARC
   - Does it follow a compelling structure? (tension → approach → resolution)
   - Is there a "turn" — a moment where assumptions were challenged or the
     direction shifted?
   - Does the reader feel pulled forward, or does it read like a flat report?

2. OPENING HOOK
   - Do the first two sentences make someone want to keep reading?
   - Is the problem framed in a way that creates stakes?
   - Suggest an alternative opening paragraph that's sharper.

3. SECTION-BY-SECTION TIGHTENING
   - For each section, note: what's working, what's filler, and what's missing.
   - Flag any sentences that are vague, passive, or could be cut.
   - Identify places where a specific detail (a number, a quote, a before/after)
     would replace a general claim.

4. VOICE & TONE
   - Does it sound like a confident professional, or like someone hedging?
   - Are there phrases that every designer uses ("user-centred", "iterative",
     "cross-functional") that could be replaced with something more specific?
   - Does the personality of the designer come through?

5. IMPACT REWRITE
   - The impact section is often the weakest. Suggest a rewritten version that
     includes: a measurable outcome, a qualitative signal, and a forward-looking
     statement about what this work enabled.

Provide your feedback inline, then summarise the three highest-leverage edits
at the end.

## Specific Content Suggestions for Export Service

These are the concrete changes I'd prioritise, based on applying the lenses above to your current content.

### 1. Rewrite the Impact section (highest priority)

Your current Impact section is two general paragraphs. Here's a structure to aim for:

**Suggested structure:**

- **A lead metric or outcome** — even directional. E.g. "Since launch, the Export Service has onboarded X businesses..." or "Registration completion rates improved by..." If you don't have exact figures, use phrasing like "reduced average onboarding time from days to under an hour" or whatever is truthfully directional.
- **A user signal** — a quote from testing, a support ticket trend, a change in behaviour. E.g. "In post-launch interviews, exporters described the verification process as straightforward — a shift from the previous system where X% of users required phone support to complete registration."
- **A system-level outcome** — what this work enabled beyond the immediate feature. E.g. "The account platform became the foundation for X subsequent services, and the authentication patterns I designed were adopted across Y other department products."
- **A personal reflection** — one sentence about what you learned or would do differently. This signals self-awareness and maturity.

### 2. Sharpen the opening problem statement

Your current overview opens with "Exporters struggled with fragmented department systems..." which is functional but generic. Consider reframing around stakes:

Something like: "Australia's $X billion export industry relies on government certification at every step. But the systems exporters used to manage that relationship were fragmented across multiple departments — each with its own login, its own forms, and no shared view of status. For the 2,000+ businesses that depend on timely approvals, this wasn't just an inconvenience — delays meant cargo sitting in port."

This kind of framing gives the reader a reason to care before you explain the solution.

### 3. Add a "what we learned from research" moment

You mention running usability sessions via Askable, but never share the insight. Pick one finding that changed your design direction and write 2–3 sentences about it. For example:

"In our first round of testing, we expected users to prefer the Digital ID path since it offered fuller access. Instead, 6 of 8 participants attempted email sign-in first — it felt more familiar and less risky. This shifted our approach: rather than treating email sign-in as a fallback, we designed it as a first-class path with clear guidance about what additional access Digital ID would unlock."

Even if the specifics are different, this pattern — "we expected X, we found Y, so we did Z" — is what reviewers want to see.

### 4. Add design rationale to the navigation section

Your navigation section shows the business-context switcher but doesn't explain the design challenge. Consider adding something like:

"The key tension was between visibility and simplicity. Users managing a single business didn't need a switcher cluttering their interface, but users managing five entities needed to change context constantly. We explored [approaches considered] before settling on [chosen approach] because [reason]. Testing confirmed that [validation]."

### 5. Strengthen your role description

Your current role bullets read like a job description. Reframe them around decisions and outcomes rather than activities:

Instead of "Created UI designs supporting user testing and development handover," try something like "Owned the end-to-end design process — from early wireframes tested with exporters, through to production specifications. I worked within the Agriculture Design System, contributing [new component] back to the system."

Instead of "Led research that defined build requirements through user feedback and data," try "Shaped the product roadmap through research — our usability findings directly influenced which features were prioritised for the next two quarters."

### 6. Consider adding a "Constraints & context" subsection

Government design work has unique constraints (accessibility standards, security requirements, legacy system integration, multi-agency coordination) that commercial designers don't face. Calling these out explicitly helps reviewers understand the difficulty of what you accomplished. A short paragraph acknowledging WCAG 2.1, the Digital Service Standard, the Agriculture Design System requirements, and the RAM integration complexity would add useful context.

## How to use these prompts

1. Copy your case study text (the content from your portfolio, not the code)
2. Paste it into a conversation with Claude or another AI tool using one of the prompts above
3. Review the feedback, then revise your content
4. Run it through a different prompt to get a second perspective
5. Repeat until you're satisfied — usually 2–3 rounds is enough

The prompts are designed to be reusable across all your case studies, not just Export Service.
