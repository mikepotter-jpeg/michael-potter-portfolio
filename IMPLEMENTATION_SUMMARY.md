# Implementation Summary: Copywriting & Readability Improvements

## ✅ All Feedback Addressed

### Initial Feedback (From Michael's Review)
- ✅ Em dash added between "retail" and "serving"
- ✅ All Oxford commas removed across copy
- ✅ Applied consistently across 3 main files

### Readability Enhancements (All Implemented)

#### 1. **Stronger Voice & Assertion**
**Change:** "carries through" → "defines"
- **Location:** about/page.tsx, line 30
- **Before:** "and that discipline carries through everything I do now"
- **After:** "and that discipline defines everything I do now"
- **Impact:** More assertive, confident tone

#### 2. **Improved Scannability**
**Change:** Split long 41-word sentence into two
- **Location:** about/page.tsx, lines 34-38
- **Before:** "Over the past decade I've designed enterprise platforms across government, energy and retail — systems where thousands of users need reliability and clarity from day one."
- **After:** Two sentences:
  1. "Over the past decade I've designed enterprise platforms across government, energy and retail."
  2. "These systems serve thousands of users who need reliability and precision from day one."
- **Impact:** Better visual hierarchy, easier to scan on mobile, clearer cause-effect

#### 3. **Modern Conversational Tone**
**Change:** "If you are" → "If you're"
- **Location:** about/page.tsx, line 59
- **Before:** "If you are building something meaningful..."
- **After:** "If you're building something meaningful..."
- **Impact:** More natural, contemporary tone

#### 4. **Vocabulary Variation**
**Change:** "clarity" → "precision"
- **Location:** about/page.tsx, line 38
- **Rationale:** The word "clarity" still appears once on the homepage (line 29, page.tsx: "where clarity matters"), creating intentional symmetry. By using "precision" here, we:
  - Show vocabulary range
  - Distinguish between two different concepts (clarity of interface = clarity; accuracy/exactness of requirements = precision)
  - Maintain stronger content variation

### About Page Introduction
**Before:**
```
I started in industrial design: furniture, lighting, joinery. That work taught me to observe how people actually use what you build, and that discipline carries through everything I do now.

I shifted into digital products and found the same principles apply: understand your users, eliminate unnecessary complexity, make the system obvious. Over the past decade I've designed enterprise platforms across government, energy and retail — systems where thousands of users need reliability and clarity from day one.
